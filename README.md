## Architecture

### Security-First Design

The application follows a **server-side security model** where all sensitive cryptographic operations occur exclusively on the server:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Client UI     │    │  Server Actions │    │ Bitcoin Network │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ • Payment Form  │───▶│ • Wallet Gen    │───▶│ • Address Gen   │
│ • QR Display    │    │ • Private Keys  │    │ • Transactions  │
│ • Status Poll   │◀───│ • Webhook Reg   │◀───│ • Confirmations │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Component Architecture

#### Core Components

- **`/app/page.tsx`**: Main application page with payment form
- **`/app/payment/[address]/`**: Dynamic payment page for individual addresses
- **`/components/payment/`**: Payment-specific UI components

  - `PaymentForm.tsx`: User input form with amount validation
  - `QrCodeDisplay.tsx`: BIP21 URI QR code generation and display
  - `PaymentStatus.tsx`: Real-time payment status monitoring

- **`/actions/payment.ts`**: Server Actions for secure payment processing
- **`/api/webhook/payment-update/`**: BlockCypher webhook endpoint

- **`/lib/api/blockcypher.ts`**: BlockCypher API client with retry logic
- **`/lib/store/payment-status.ts`**: File-based payment status persistence
- **`/lib/validation/`**: Zod schemas for data validation

### Data Flow

1. **Payment Request Creation**:

   ```
   Form Submission → Server Action → HD Wallet Generation → Address Creation → Webhook Registration → QR Code Display
   ```

2. **Payment Processing**:
   ```
   Bitcoin Transaction → BlockCypher Detection → Webhook Notification → Status Update → Client Polling → UI Update
   ```

## Blockchain Integration

### HD Wallet Implementation

The application implements a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet system following Bitcoin standards:

- **BIP39**: Mnemonic phrase generation (12 words, 128-bit entropy)
- **BIP32**: HD wallet derivation from seed with hardened derivation
- **BIP84**: Native SegWit address generation (P2WPKH)
- **Derivation Path**: `m/84'/1'/0'/0/index` (testnet native SegWit with hardened derivation)

#### Hardened Derivation Security

The application uses **hardened derivation** (indicated by the `'` apostrophe) for the first three levels of the BIP32 path:

- `m/84'` - **Purpose** (hardened): BIP84 for native SegWit
- `/1'` - **Coin Type** (hardened): Bitcoin testnet
- `/0'` - **Account** (hardened): First account

```typescript
// Hardened derivation prevents child key exposure
// Even if a child private key is compromised, parent keys remain secure
const hardenedPath = "m/84'/1'/0'/0/0"; // First 3 levels hardened
```

**Security Benefits:**

- **Parent Key Protection**: Hardened derivation ensures that if a child private key is compromised, it cannot be used to derive the parent key or sibling keys
- **Extended Public Key Safety**: Hardened keys cannot be derived from extended public keys alone
- **Industry Standard**: Follows BIP44/BIP84 standards for secure wallet architecture

#### Wallet Security Features

```typescript
// Example: Secure address generation (server-side only)
export function generateWalletAddress(): string {
  const mnemonic = generateMnemonic(); // BIP39 mnemonic
  const seed = mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic); // PBKDF2 seed derivation
  const hdRoot = generateHDRoot(seed, testnet); // BIP32 master key
  const address = deriveTestnetAddress(hdRoot); // BIP84 P2WPKH address

  // Private keys never leave this function scope
  return address; // Only public address returned
}
```

### Address Generation Strategy

Each payment request generates a **new unique address** to ensure:

- **Privacy**: No address reuse, preventing transaction linkability
- **Security**: Fresh entropy for each payment
- **Tracking**: Individual payment monitoring per address
- **Standards Compliance**: Native SegWit (tb1...) addresses for lower fees

### Network Configuration

The application currently operates on **Bitcoin Testnet 3** with plans for mainnet support:

- **Current**: Testnet addresses (`tb1...`, `m...`, `n...`, `2...`)
- **Future**: Environment-based network switching (see [Future Improvements](#future-improvements))

## Webhook System

### BlockCypher Integration

Real-time payment monitoring through BlockCypher's webhook service:

```typescript
// Webhook registration for payment monitoring
export async function registerPaymentWebhook(
  address: string,
  callbackUrl: string
): Promise<string[]> {
  // Register for unconfirmed transactions (0-conf)
  const unconfirmedWebhook = await registerWebhook({
    event: "unconfirmed-tx",
    address,
    url: callbackUrl,
  });

  // Register for confirmed transactions (1+ conf)
  const confirmedWebhook = await registerWebhook({
    event: "tx-confirmation",
    address,
    url: callbackUrl,
    confirmations: 1,
  });

  return [unconfirmedWebhook.id, confirmedWebhook.id];
}
```

### Webhook Processing Pipeline

1. **Event Reception**: `/api/webhook/payment-update` receives BlockCypher notifications
2. **Payload Validation**: Zod schema validation for webhook data integrity
3. **Transaction Parsing**: Extract transaction details (hash, confirmations, amounts)
4. **Status Updates**: Update file-based payment status store
5. **Client Notification**: Real-time updates via polling (WebSocket upgrade planned)

### Supported Events

- `unconfirmed-tx`: Zero-confirmation transaction detection
- `tx-confirmation`: Transaction confirmation events
- `double-spend-tx`: Double-spend attempt detection

### Error Handling

- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Webhook Failures**: Graceful degradation, payment requests continue without webhooks
- **Network Issues**: Persistent storage ensures no data loss during outages

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- BlockCypher API token (free tier available)
- HTTPS-accessible webhook URL for production

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd bitcoin-payment-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Required: BlockCypher API token
BLOCKCYPHER_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Required for webhook registration (auto-detected on Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Optional: Vercel deployment (automatically set)
VERCEL_URL=your-vercel-app.vercel.app
```

### Development Server

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Local Webhook Testing with ngrok

For local development and testing webhooks, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet:

### Testing with Electrum Wallet

To test Bitcoin transactions locally, you can use Electrum wallet in testnet mode:

```bash
# macOS: Run Electrum in testnet mode
open -a Electrum --args --testnet
```

This allows you to send testnet Bitcoin to your generated addresses for testing the payment flow.

```bash
# Install ngrok (if not already installed)
npm install -g ngrok
# or visit https://ngrok.com/download

# In a separate terminal, expose your local server
ngrok http 3000

# ngrok will provide an HTTPS URL like: https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

**Setup with ngrok:**

1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Start ngrok in another terminal**: `ngrok http 3000`
3. **Copy the HTTPS URL** from ngrok output (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
4. **Set environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```
5. **Test webhook registration**: Create a payment request and verify webhook calls in ngrok logs

**ngrok Benefits for Development:**

- **HTTPS Required**: BlockCypher requires HTTPS URLs for webhooks
- **Real-time Testing**: Test actual webhook notifications from BlockCypher
- **Request Inspection**: View webhook payloads in ngrok dashboard
- **No Configuration**: Works with localhost without additional setup

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: All critical modules (wallet, validation, API clients)
- **Integration Tests**: Payment flow and webhook processing
- **Mocking**: External dependencies (BlockCypher API) mocked for testing
- **Security Focus**: Test coverage for all security-critical paths

## Future Improvements

### 1. Network Configuration Enhancement

**Environment-Based Network Switching**: Implement a comprehensive environment variable system to switch between testnet and mainnet:

```typescript
// Proposed environment configuration
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  BITCOIN_NETWORK: process.env.BITCOIN_NETWORK || "testnet", // 'testnet' | 'mainnet'
  // Automatically configure all dependent services:
  // - Wallet derivation paths
  // - Address prefixes
  // - BlockCypher network endpoints
  // - BIP21 URI network parameters
};
```

**Implementation Benefits:**

- Single environment variable controls entire network stack
- Automatic derivation path switching (m/84'/0'/... for mainnet, m/84'/1'/... for testnet)
- Network-appropriate address generation and validation
- BlockCypher endpoint switching (btc/main vs btc/test3)

### 2. Extended Public Key (xPub) Integration

**User-Provided xPub Support**: Allow users to provide their own extended public keys for address generation:

#### What is xPub?

An **Extended Public Key (xPub)** is a Bitcoin standard that allows generation of unlimited child public keys (and their corresponding addresses) from a single master key, **without exposing any private keys**.

#### Benefits of xPub Integration:

- **User Control**: Users maintain control of their private keys
- **Address Generation**: Generate unlimited receiving addresses from user's xPub
- **Watch-Only Wallet**: Monitor payments without access to spend funds
- **Privacy**: No need to share individual addresses beforehand

#### Proposed Implementation:

```typescript
// User provides their xPub during payment setup
interface XPubPaymentRequest {
  xpub: string; // User's extended public key
  derivationIndex: number; // Address index to generate
  amount: number; // Payment amount
}

// Generate address from user's xPub
export function deriveAddressFromXPub(
  xpub: string,
  index: number,
  network: "mainnet" | "testnet"
): string {
  // Validate xPub format and network compatibility
  const masterKey = bip32.fromBase58(xpub, bitcoinNetwork);

  // Derive receiving address: m/0/index (standard BIP44 receiving chain)
  const childKey = masterKey.derive(0).derive(index);

  // Generate appropriate address for network
  const { address } = bitcoin.payments.p2wpkh({
    pubkey: childKey.publicKey,
    network: bitcoinNetwork,
  });

  return address;
}
```

#### Integration Flow:

1. **User Input**: User provides xPub through extended payment form
2. **Validation**: Verify xPub format and network compatibility
3. **Address Derivation**: Generate specific address using provided derivation index
4. **Payment Monitoring**: Monitor generated address for incoming payments
5. **Status Updates**: Notify user of payment status through existing webhook system

#### Security Considerations:

- **xPub Validation**: Strict validation of xPub format and network compatibility
- **No Private Key Access**: System never has access to private keys
- **Derivation Limits**: Implement reasonable limits on derivation indices
- **Network Matching**: Ensure xPub network matches configured network

### 3. Advanced Payment Features

- **Fee Estimation**: Real-time fee estimation based on mempool conditions
- **Transaction Batching**: Combine multiple payments for improved efficiency and lower fees

#### Multi-Signature Support

- **M-of-N Multi-Sig**: Enhanced security through multi-signature wallets
- **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Support for Ledger, Trezor, and other hardware wallets
- **Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT)**: Collaborative transaction signing

### 4. Developer Experience & Infrastructure

#### Real-time Communication

#### Database & Storage Enhancements

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Replace file-based storage with robust database
- **Redis Caching**: High-performance caching for payment status and session data
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup strategies with point-in-time recovery

### 5. Multiple Transaction Handling Enhancement

**Multiple Payments to Same Address**: Currently, the application only tracks the latest transaction to each address, overwriting previous payment data. This creates a limitation for real-world Bitcoin usage patterns where users might send multiple payments to the same address.

#### Current Limitation:

- When multiple BTC transactions are sent to the same address, only the **most recent transaction** is tracked
- Previous transaction details (amount, transaction ID, confirmations) are **overwritten** in the payment status store
- Users only see the latest payment amount, not the **cumulative total**
- Transaction history is lost, making reconciliation difficult

#### Proposed Solution:

Implement a transaction accumulation system that tracks all payments to each address:

- **Transaction Array**: Store all transactions as an array instead of single transaction fields
- **Cumulative Totals**: Calculate running totals of all payments received
- **Enhanced Status Logic**: Support `PARTIALLY_PAID`, `OVERPAID`, and `PAYMENT_COMPLETE` states
- **Transaction History UI**: Display all individual payments and their confirmation status

#### Files Requiring Changes:

**Core Data Structure:**

- `/src/types/index.ts` - Add `PaymentTransaction` interface and enhanced payment status types
- `/src/lib/store/payment-status.ts` - Replace single transaction fields with `transactions[]` array and implement accumulation logic

**Webhook Processing:**

- `/src/app/api/webhook/payment-update/route.ts` - Update webhook handler to append transactions instead of replacing them

**API Layer:**

- `/src/app/api/payment-status/[address]/route.ts` - Return transaction history and cumulative totals in response

**Frontend Components:**

- `/src/components/payment/PaymentStatus.tsx` - Display transaction list, progress bar, and cumulative totals
- `/src/hooks/usePaymentStatus.ts` - Handle new enhanced payment status response structure

**Payment Creation:**

- `/src/actions/payment.ts` - Pass expected amount for completion tracking during payment initialization

**Validation & Parsing:**

- `/src/lib/validation/webhook.ts` - Update schemas for new transaction structure
- `/src/lib/utils/webhook-parser.ts` - Ensure compatibility with transaction accumulation approach

**Testing:**

- All test files in `__tests__/` - Update mocks and add tests for multiple transaction scenarios

This enhancement would provide a more robust payment system that naturally handles partial payments, overpayments, and provides complete transaction visibility for better user experience and business reconciliation.

### 6. Dynamic Routing Enhancement

**Dynamic Routes for Generated Addresses and Transactions**: The application now includes dynamic route structures that provide direct access to specific payment addresses, with transaction details planned for future implementation.

#### Implementation Status:

✅ **Dynamic Address Routes**: Implemented `/app/payment/[address]/page.tsx` for direct address access
⏳ **Transaction Detail Routes**: Planned implementation for `/app/transaction/[txHash]/page.tsx`

#### Current Implementation:

**Dynamic Address Routes:**

```typescript
// /app/payment/[address]/page.tsx - Direct address access (IMPLEMENTED)
export default async function PaymentPage({ params }: PaymentPageProps) {
  const { address } = await params;
  
  // Validate address format (Bitcoin testnet addresses)
  if (!isValidTestnetAddress(address)) {
    notFound();
  }

  // Get payment status from the store
  const paymentStatus = await getPaymentStatus(address);
  
  // Display comprehensive payment information for specific address
  // Shows QR code, payment URI, transaction history, and real-time status
}

// /app/transaction/[txHash]/page.tsx - Transaction details (PLANNED)
export default function TransactionDetailsPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { txHash: string };
}) {
  // Display detailed transaction information
  // Show confirmations, block height, inputs/outputs, and network status
}
```

#### Benefits:

**User Experience:**

- **Direct Access**: Users can bookmark and share specific payment addresses
- **Deep Linking**: Email notifications can link directly to payment status pages
- **Transaction Exploration**: Direct links to transaction details for transparency
- **Mobile Sharing**: Easy QR code sharing via direct address URLs

**Business Value:**

- **Customer Support**: Support teams can quickly access specific payment details
- **Payment Tracking**: Customers can track payments without navigating through forms
- **Integration Friendly**: Third-party systems can link directly to payment pages
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines can index payment-related content appropriately

**Technical Advantages:**

- **Stateless URLs**: Payment status accessible without session or form state
- **Caching Optimization**: Static generation for transaction detail pages
- **API Consistency**: Align frontend routes with existing API structure
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with or without JavaScript enabled

#### Example URL Structure:

```
https://yourapp.com/payment/tb1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh  # ✅ IMPLEMENTED
https://yourapp.com/transaction/1a2b3c4d5e6f...                          # ⏳ PLANNED
```

**Current Status**: The dynamic address routing enhancement has been implemented, transforming the application from a purely form-based payment processor into a more comprehensive system with direct address access. Transaction detail pages are planned for future implementation.
